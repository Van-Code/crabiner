## 🦔 How to Use This Space Safely

### **For Posters:**

1. **Protect your privacy**

   - Don't share your last name, workplace, or home address
   - Use general locations ("Castro neighborhood" not "123 Main St")
   - Save your inbox link securely

2. **Be specific but not creepy**

   - ✅ "You were at Blue Bottle on Monday morning wearing a Pride pin"
   - ❌ "I've been watching you at this coffee shop for 3 weeks"

3. **Set realistic expectations**

   - Not everyone will see your post
   - The person may not remember you
   - They may not be interested - and that's okay

4. **Trust your instincts**
   - If a reply feels off, don't respond
   - You can delete messages or your whole post anytime
   - Block and report concerning behavior

### **For Repliers:**

1. **Be respectful**

   - Even if you don't remember them, be kind
   - It takes courage to post - don't mock or shame

2. **Verify it's really you**

   - Include details only the person who saw you would know
   - Be honest if you're not sure it's about you

3. **Respect "no"**

   - If they don't respond, don't push
   - One message is enough

4. **Keep initial messages appropriate**
   - Introduce yourself
   - Reference the situation they described
   - Suggest a low-pressure way to connect (coffee, public place)
